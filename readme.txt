Manage Contact Form 7 messages directly in WordPress like leads in the CRM system.

== Description ==
MangoFp allows managing Contact Form 7 form submissions directly in WordPress. They will be handled like messages or leads in the CRM system. Information and service requests, various registration forms - all can be managed according to the tailor-made process that is best for you.

All incoming form submissions (messages) are gathered in one place. Each lead is always assigned to a process step. Initially, it is **New**. Then you decide what action is needed with the lead and it can move to the step **In Progress** or **Accepted** or something else specific to your process.

Reply via email to form submissions directly from MangoFp. Your replies can be based on pre-defined email templates.


== Installation ==
1. Check that you have installed the plugin **Contact Form 7**.
2. You should also have at least one  Contact Form 7 form in use on your WordPress website. If you want to reply to form submissions from MangoFP,  your form(s) should contain an email field. MangoFP recognizes the email field automatically when its name is *your-name* (default for Contact Form 7)
3. Install and activate **MangoFP**
4. In Admin Area open MangoFP->Settings. On tab **Parameters** you can specify **Email field** if that is something else than *your-email*. On the tab "Define process steps" you can modify the process for management of the messages.  See detailed instructions on plugin [webpage](https://mangofp.net)
5. Open your page with a form on your webpage and submit some data.  
6. In Admin Area open MangoFP->Contacts. You should see your form submission as a new message.
